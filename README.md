# Adam Hutchings

## Non-programming info
Hi! I'm an 18-year-old student in the United States. I attend [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu), expecting to graduate in 2026, and studying computer science and mathematics. Outside of school, I also enjoy linguistics, singing, music composition, and cooking.

## My programming history
I got into programming through my local robotics team in late 2019, doing Python, and since
then I've also used Java, C++, and C.

## What am I most proud of?
I'm most proud of my [Minecraft clone](https://github.com/adamhutchings/Minecraft3D) which
I developed mostly in the early summer of 2021. It uses C++ and OpenGL to create a world
loader which goes on infinitely and lets you break blocks. This is my best completed project,
although I have many others.

## What am I working on currently?
In the world of programming, I am currently learning machine learning and neural networks by way of creating [my own machine-learning engine](https://github.com/adamhutchings/cml) from scratch in C. As for mathematics, I am currently studying partial differential equations.

## Contact me
Please reach out to me at ash160 at my university's domain.
