# Adam Hutchings

## Non-programming info
I'm an 18 year old college freshman in the United States. Outside of programming, I like
linguistics, math, and cooking. I'm at [Case](https://case.edu) studying computer science and mathematics.

## My programming history
I got into programming through my local robotics team in late 2019, doing Python, and since
then I've also used Java, C++, and C.

## What am I most proud of?
I'm most proud of my [Minecraft clone](https://github.com/adamhutchings/Minecraft3D) which
I developed mostly in the early summer of 2021. It uses C++ and OpenGL to create a world
loader which goes on infinitely and lets you break blocks.

## What am I working on currently?
I'm working on Y-flat, a programming language still in development, with my longtime collaborator
[Jake Roggenbuck](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck) among others. I'm working on its
[compiler](https://github.com/adamhutchings/yfc) and he's working on the [installer](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/yfin).

## Contact me
You can reach me at \[my first name\] (dot) abahot (at) gmail \[you know what\] com.
If I see it through the influx of emails from colleges. :-)
