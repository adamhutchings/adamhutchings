## Non-programming info
I'm an 18 year old college sophomore in the United States. Outside of programming, I like
linguistics, math, music, writing, and cooking. I'm at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu) studying computer science and math.
Hi! I'm an 18-year-old student in the United States. I attend [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu), expecting to graduate in 2026, and studying computer science and mathematics.

## My programming history
I got into programming through my local robotics team in late 2019, doing Python, and since
then I've also used Java, C++, and C.

## What am I most proud of?
I'm most proud of my [Minecraft clone](https://github.com/adamhutchings/Minecraft3D) which
I developed mostly in the early summer of 2021. It uses C++ and OpenGL to create a world
loader which goes on infinitely and lets you break blocks. This is my best completed project --
`yfc` as mentioned below is still in development.

## What am I working on currently?
In the world of programming, I am currently learning machine learning and neural networks by way of creating [my own machine-learning engine](https://github.com/adamhutchings/cml) from scratch in C. As for mathematics, I am currently studying partial differential equations.
