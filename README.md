# Adam Hutchings

## Non-programming info
Hi! I'm a 20-year-old student in the United States. I attend [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu), expecting to graduate in 2026, and studying computer science and mathematics. Outside of school, I also enjoy a few other things:
- singing (especially classical and barbershop music)
- music composition + playing piano
- writing (short stories + novels)
- cooking

## My programming history
I got into programming through my local robotics team in late 2019, doing Python, and since
then I've also used a few other languages:
- Java for games.
- C++ for slightly more advanced games.
- C for language tooling.
- Scheme, Haskell, and Prolog for coursework.

## What am I most proud of?
I'm most proud of my [Minecraft clone](https://github.com/adamhutchings/Minecraft3D) which
I developed mostly in the early summer of 2021. It uses C++ and OpenGL to create a world
loader which goes on infinitely and lets you break blocks. This is my best completed project,
although I have many others.

## What am I working on currently?
I am currently a software developer intern at [Epic](https://www.epic.com/) in the summer of 2025, and besides that
I am working on writing stories and learning mathematics.

## Contact me
Please reach out to me at ash160 at my university's domain.
